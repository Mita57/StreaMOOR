## Intoduction

Despite all the efforts from companies such as youtube and mixer, twitch.tv's streaming platform dominance still seems unstoppable, which is really strange considering all the scandals regarding banning people for doing comparatively nothing much. 
This has to end one time or another, so this is the most ambitious project to do that yet.

## Our plans to conquer the world

We want to build a streaming platform, that will be useful for everyone, not only for gaming.
Though we intend to keep our content level high, so don't expect any periscope-level questionable stuff.
All that will be streamed on this platform shall be of high quality, interesting and you probably won't get banned for it, unless you went too far of course. Having all streamers and themes that are interesting for you in one place is our goal.

## In Moor we trust
Our Philosophy is based on ideas of the greatest creator of all times - Pavel Clementyevich Moor, who created such things as Universe, Python and Alcohol. These things are also the three whales of our code 
   * Universe is mostly dark and empty, so are our repos</li>
   * We follow python's zen, when we are not drunk</li>
   * We are always drunk</li>
   
   
## The creators of this masterpiece:
* Timofey Myachikov
* Sergo Kosterin
* Igor Krupkin
* Nastya Ekimova
